# ChatGPTDatabaseQuery
Ask ChatGPT questions regarding your own data and get answers with cited proof.

In this example, we have The Book **And Then There Were None** by Dame Agatha Christie. We send queries to a selected GPT model using the OpenAI API. The sample queries are posed to demand citations from the book as proof for the model's inference. We can validate that these exact quotes are indeed in the source material.
